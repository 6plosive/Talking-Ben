# Talking-Ben
Basically a command prompt style Talking Ben, I will add more and more funcionality. 

1.0.0
-Basic function of calling talking ben. Saying yes, no, hohoho and ajosdhfuisgisdf when you talk with him. very basic. 

1.1.0
-Added a main menu.
-Super epic ascii art in the menu.
-Detect if you typed anything or not. If not, tells you to type something. 
-Allow you to type exit to exit the game. (omg so cool)

This is my first script/game/project. I am a big newb and hope you enjoy my game.
